# Invoicing service where users can fill up the invoice data and generate invoices.
Application was developed using React.js, Redux and firestore.
The project was done in a team with other developers, and was a part of University course. I mainly worked in the Front-End, designing the UI, invoice templates and some parts in the Back-End as well.
